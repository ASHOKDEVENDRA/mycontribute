/* SAS Program COVID_19 
Cleveland Clinic and SAS Collaboarion

These models are only as good as their inputs. Input values for this type of model are very dynamic and may need to be evaluated across wide ranges and reevaluated as the epidemic progresses.  This work is currently defaulting to values for the population studied in the Cleveland Clinic and SAS collaboration.  You need to evaluate each parameter for your population of interest.

SAS and Cleveland Clinic are not responsible for any misuse of these techniques.
